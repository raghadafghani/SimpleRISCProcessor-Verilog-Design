# SimpleRISCProcessor-Verilog-Design
This project focuses on creating and testing a basic Multi-Cycle RISC processor using the HDL Verilog language. The processor has a 32-bit instruction format and includes 32 general-purpose registers (R0 to R31) and a program counter (PC). It also has a control stack for storing return addresses, which is managed by a stack pointer (SP) that points to the top of the stack. The stack is assumed to be implemented using on-chip memory, and the initial value of SP is zero. The processor supports four types of instructions: R-type, I-type, J-type, and S-type. It has an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) with a "zero" output signal that indicates when the result of the previous ALU operation is zero. Additionally, the design includes separate memories for data and instructions.
